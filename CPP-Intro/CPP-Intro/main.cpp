  //  a structure.  (An instance is simply when you create an actual object
  //  from the class, as opposed to having the definition of the class)

//Inline funcitons
//Inline functions are best for small functions that are called often
//When you call it the compiler will replace the function call with the actual code from the function
//Function calls on the stack can slow down the program

inline void hello()
{
  cout<<"hello";
}
int main()
{
  hello(); //Call it like a normal function...
  cin.get();
}
